# Binary Relations

Just as a set can be viewed as a collection of
individual objects of some type, α, specified by a
membership predicate on α, so we will now view at
a binary relation on α and β as a collection of
ordered pairs of objects, ( a : α, b : β ), and
we will specify such a relation with a two-argument
predicate on α and β.
-/

/-!
## Specification and Representation as Predicates

You'll recall from the section on sets that Lean
defines the type, (Set α), as the type, α → Prop.
Not every predicate is meant to represent a set,
so Lean provides the (Set α) definition so that
our code expresses the intended abstraction when
we mean for such a predicate to represent a set.
-/

axiom α : Type
axiom β : Type
#reduce (types := true) (Set α)     -- α → Prop
-- The type, Set α, is defined as the type α → Prop
-- (types := true) tells Lean to reduce types

/-!
## Rel α β: The Type of Binary Relations From α to β

Lean provides a similar abstraction for speciying
binary relations. It's (Rel α β), correspondingly
defined as α → β → Prop. We will thus specify and
represent any binary relation, r, of type (Rel α β)
as a two-argument predicate of type α → β → Prop.
-/

#reduce (types := true) Rel α β -- is α → β → Prop

/-
## A Tiny Example
Let's consider a simple example. Suppose we want
to represent a relation, let's call it tiny, with
the following pairs: { (0,1,), (1,1), (1,0) }. We
can start by writing a membership predicate that
is satisfied by all and only these pairs.
-/

def tinyMembershipPred : Nat → Nat → Prop :=
  fun fst snd =>
    fst = 0 ∧ snd = 1 ∨
    fst = 1 ∧ snd = 1 ∨
    fst = 1 ∧ snd = 0

/-!
When applied to a pair of Nat values, this
membership predicate yields a proposition about
the given pair of values that might or might not
be true. If it's true, that proves the pair is in
the relation. If it's false, that proves the pair
is not in the relation.

Fr example, applying tiny it to the pair of values,
such as 1 and 1, produces a a proposition, computed
by substituing the actual parameters (1 and 1) for
the formal parameters (fst, snd) in its definition.
Here we ask Lean to do this reduction for us. To
see the result, hover over #reduce or use Lean's
InfoView panel.
-/

#reduce (types := true) tinyMembershipPred 1 1
-- 1 = 0 ∧ 1 = 1 ∨ 1 = 1 ∧ 1 = 1 ∨ 1 = 1 ∧ 1 = 0

/-!
We can now define tiny as a bianry relation on Nat,
giving the membership predicate as its specification.
-/

def tiny : Rel Nat Nat := tinyMembershipPred

/-!
Now we're working across two levels of abstraction:
that of a binary relation, and that of the logical
predicate that specifies and represents it.

The tiny relation still acts just like a predicate.
We can apply it to a pair of arguments to produce a
membership proposition, the truth of which determines
whether the given pair of values is in relation or not.
It should be obvious that the membership proposition
is true for (tiny 1 1) and false for, e.g., (2, 2).
-/

#reduce (types := true) tiny 2 2
-- 2 = 0 ∧ 2 = 1 ∨ 2 = 1 ∧ 2 = 1 ∨ 2 = 1 ∧ 2 = 0

/-!
Relation-definitng predicates can defined using all
the various forms of logical expression: ∧, ∨, ¬, →,
↔, ∀, and ∃. Proving membership or not in an arbitrary
binary relation thus requires facility with proving
the full ranges of these types of proposition.
-/

/-!
## Proving Membership and Non-Membership Propositions

Now just as we proved set membership and non-membership
propositions by reducing these propositions to logical
propositions determined by the set membership predicate,
so now we do the same for binary relations.

Suppose we want to prove that (informally speaking) that
(0, 1) is in the tiny relation. We can start the proof by
saying this: *By the definition of tiny, what we are to
prove is 0 = 0 ∧ 1 = 1 ∨ 0 = 1 ∧ 1 = 1 ∨ 0 = 1 ∧ 1 = 0.
The remainder of the proof is then just an exercise in
*logical* proof construction, which you should now have
fully mastered.
-/

#reduce (types:=true) tiny 0 1

-- Prove (0, 1) is in tiny
example : tiny 0 1 :=
  /-
  By the definition of tiny what is to be proved is
  0 = 0 ∧ 1 = 1 ∨ 0 = 1 ∧ 1 = 1 ∨ 0 = 1 ∧ 1 = 0. The
  proof is by *or introduction* on the left with ...
  -/
  Or.inl
    -- ... a proof of fst = 0 ∧ snd = 1
    (
      -- this proposition is proved by "and" introduction
      And.intro
        -- with a proof of 0 = 0 (parens needed here)
        (Eq.refl 0)
        -- and a proof of 1 = 1 (parens needed)
        (Eq.refl 1)
    )

/-!
Proving that a pair is not in a relation is done in the
usual way: by negation. That is, one assumes the pair is
in the relation and then shows that that cannot actually
be true, leading one to conclude that the negation of that
proposition is true. For example, let's show that (0, 0)
is not in the tiny relation.
-/

#reduce (types:=true) tiny 0 0
-- 0 = 0 ∧ 0 = 1 ∨ 0 = 1 ∧ 0 = 1 ∨ 0 = 1 ∧ 0 = 0


example : ¬tiny 0 0 :=
  -- The proof is by negation: we assume (0, 0) is in tiny ...
  fun (h : tiny 0 0) =>
    -- and show that this proof can't reallky exist
    -- the proof is by case analysis on h (Or.elim)
    match h with
    -- case (0, 0) = (0, 1)? I.e., 0 = 0 ∧ 0 = 1? Nope.
    -- by case analysis on a proof of 0 = 1 (no proofs)
    | Or.inl h01 => nomatch h01.right
    -- analyze the two remaining cases
    | Or.inr h11orh10 =>
      match h11orh10 with
      -- case (0, 0) = (1, 1)? I.e., 0 = 1 ∧ 0 = 1? Nope.
      | Or.inl h11 => nomatch h11.left
      -- case (0, 0) = (1, 0), i.e., 0 = 1 ∧ 0 = 0? Nope.
      | Or.inr h10 => nomatch h10.left

  /-
    As there can be no proof of (tiny 0 0), i.e., of
    0 = 0 ∧ 0 = 1 ∨ 0 = 1 ∧ 0 = 1 ∨ 0 = 1 ∧ 0 = 0, we
    conclude that (0, 0) is not in the tiny relation:
    ¬tiny 0 0. QED.
  -/

/-!
## Concrete Notations for Binary Relations

So far we've applied relation names to arguments using
prefix notation, e.g., tiny 0 0, with the relation name
first and then its two arguments. It's often convenient
to use infix notation instead. Sometimes it will be most
convenient to put the relation namebetween its arguments.
Sometimes it'll be best to use a mathematical symbol in
lieu of the relation name.  Let's see how to set this up
in Lean. -/

/-!
Suppose r is some arbitrary relation on α and β, and
that a and b are suitable arguments.
-/


axiom r : Rel α β
axiom a : α
axiom b : β

-- Here's the abstract syntax for "r relates a to b"
#check r a b

/-!
Here are two concrete syntax notations. We give them
minimal precedences here so that expressions on either
side group before the relation is applied to them.
-/

infix:min " ≺ " => r
infix:min " r " => r

/-!
If r is a "likes" relation (meant to express who likes
whom), it'd make sense to use "likes" in infix position.
Instead of (likes a b) we could write (a likes b). If r
is a "precedes" relation (representing an ordering, e.g.,
the lexicographic order on Strings). we might want to use
≺ as an infix symbol. We'd write (precedes a b) as a ≺ b
and read this as "a precedes b".
-/
#check a r b
#check a ≺ b

/-!
In the rest of this file we'll just use prefix notation.
The remainder of this chapter presents additional concepts
with worked examples.

## Examples Worked Out In Detail

We now explore a range of particular relations to illustrate
concepts, specifications, propositions, and proofs involving
them.

### The Complete Relation from α to β

Given sets (in type theory, types) α and β, the *complete*
relation from α to β relates every value of type α to every
value of type β.

#### Specification

The total relation from α to β is "isomorphic" to the
product set/type, α × β, having every (a : α, b : β) pair
as a member. The corresponding membership predicate takes
two arguments, ignores them, and reduces to the membership
proposition, True. As there's always a proof of True, the
membership proposition is true for every pair of values,
so every pair of values is defined to be in the relation.
Here's a general definition of the total relation on any
two types, α and β.
-/

def totalRel (α β : Type*) : Rel α β := fun _ _ => True

/-!
#### Worked Example
that relates every String to every Nat (natural number). This
relation imposes no conditions on which String-Nat pairs are in
the relation, so they all are.

The predicate defining this relation has to be true for *all*
pairs of values. The solution is for the predicate to yield the
proposition, True, for which there is always a proof, for *any*
pair of String and Nat values. In paper and pencil set theoretic
mathematics we could define fullStringNat as { (s,n ) | True }.
In the type theory of Lean, we'll specify the relation using
its predicate represented as a function, as usual.
-/

def completeStrNat : Rel String Nat := totalRel String Nat

/-
Given this definition we can show that any pair of values is in
the relation, or related to each other through or by it. As one
example, let's show that the pair of values, "Hello" and 7, is in
this relation. Hint. Start by *remembering* the definition of
completeStrNat, then start natural language proof by saying, "By
the definition of completeStrNat, what is to be proved is True."
Then prove that membership proposition.
-/

-- Prove ("Hello", 7) is in the total relation on String and Nat
example : completeStrNat "Hello" 7 :=
  -- By the definition of completeStrNat, all we have to prove True
  -- The proof is by True introduction
  True.intro

-- Prove that *every* Nat-Nat pair is in completeStrNat
example : ∀ (a : String) (b : Nat), completeStrNat a b :=
  -- The proof is by ∀ introduction applied twice: assume (a b : Nat)
    fun a => fun b =>
    -- what remains to be proved is completeStrNat a b
    -- by the definition of completeStrNat, this is just True
    -- the proof is by True introduction
    True.intro

/-!
To know to "unfold" definitions into their underlying
definitions is an incredibly important and useful move
in in proof construction. I'd recommend that if you're
ever stuck proving a proposition, just look to see if
you can unfold any definitions to reveal more clearly
what actually needs to be proved. Sometimes even Lean
will get stuck computing proofs automatically until you
tell it to unfold a definition in the midst of a proof
construction.
-/

/-!
### The Empty Binary Relation From α to β

The empty relation from any type/set α to and type/set β
is the relation that relates no values of α to any values
of β. It's the relation that contains no pairs.

#### Specification

We specify the empty on α and β with a membership predicate
that is false for any pair of values. It's a predicate that
ignores its arguments and yields the membership proposition,
False. No pair satisfies this membership proposition (makes
it true), so the specified relation has no pairs at all.
-/

def emptyRel {α β : Type*} : Rel α β := fun _ _ => False

/-
The domain of definition of the empty relation is still
the set of all values of type α, and the co-domain is
still the set of all β values; but the domain and range
are both empty, because the set of pairs of r is empty.
-/

/-#### Worked Examples

Here a work through various propositions involving an
empt relation.

First we claim and show that no pair, (a : α, b : β) can
be in an empty relation.

We should be able to prove that no pair, (a : σ, b : β),
is in the pair, no matter what types α and β are and no
matter what values of these types are given as arguments.

Recall that we've already defined (a : α) and (b : β) as
arbitrary values (as axioms). The proof is by negation.

We assume(emptyRel a b) is true with a proof, h. But by
the definition of emptyRel, the membership proposition,
(emptyRel a b), is the proposition False. This makes h
a proof of False, which is what we need to conclude our
proof of ¬(emptyRel a b). QED.
-/
example : ¬emptyRel a b := fun (h : emptyRel a b) => h

/-!
As a minor note, if we handn't already assumed that a
and b are arbitrary objects, we could introduce them as
such using ∀. You can read this proposition as something
to the effect, no pair of objects, (a, b), can belong to
and empty relation on any α and β.
-/

example : ∀ {α β : Type*}, ∀ (a : α), ∀ (b : β), ¬emptyRel a b :=
/-
Proof by ∀ introduction. We assume arbitrary and and b and
then show that this pair cannot be in an empty relation. The
rest of the proof is by negation. We assume (h : emptyRel a b)
and produce a proof of False. By the definition of emptyRel,
(h : emptyRel x y) *is* a proof of False. Therefore, we can
conclude that ¬(emptyRel x y).
-/
fun a b =>     -- assume arbitrary a and b (can use _'s here)
  fun h =>     -- assume a proof of (emptyRel a b), call it h
    h          -- It *is* a proof of False, thus ¬emptyRel a b.


/-
Next we claim and prove the claim that no pair can Be in
the empty relation from String to Nat, in particular.

The empty relation on String and Nat is just the polymorphic
(with type arguments) empty relation specialized to the
types, α = String and β = Nat. EmptyRel does take two Type
arguments, but they are defined to be implicit: Lean infers
them from the type of emptyStrNat, namely *Rel String Nat*.
-/

def emptyStrNat : Rel String Nat := emptyRel

/-!
The proofs don't really change.
-/

example : ∀ s n, ¬emptyStrNat s n := fun s n h => h

/-
### The String-to-Length Relation

The empty and complete relation aren't very informative.
The interesting ones are proper but non-empty subsets of
the complete relation on their argument types.

#### Specification

As an example, consider the "subrelation" of our full
String to Nat relation with only the pairs, (s, n), where
*n is the length of s*. The predicate specifying this
relation is *fun s n => : n = s.length*.
-/

def strlen : Rel String Nat := fun s n => n = s.length

/-!
We want to take a moment at this point to note a critical
distinction between *relations* in Lean and functions that
are represented as lambda expressions (ordinary computable
functions in Lean. Functions in Lean and related systems
are (1) computable, and (2) total, which is to say that
they can take *any* value of the declared input type and
produce a corresponding output value.

By contrast, relations are not computable; they need not be
total (with a defined output for every input); and they can
be multi-valued, with several outputs for any given input.

Concerning totality, a quick look back at the empty relation
makes the point: the domain of definition is every value, but
the relation has no pairs: it does not define an output for
any of them. As far as being multi-valued, consider the total
relation defined about. It defines *every* value of the output
type as an output for each and every value of the input type.

Finally, consider computability. We could easily define a
computable function that *computes* to our strlen relation.
-/

def strlenFun : String → Nat := fun s => s.length
#reduce strlenFun "Hello"   -- computes 5

/-
However, our strlen relation is not a computable function,
but rather a *declarative specification*. When you apply
it to values of its input types, you get not the output of
the relation for those value, but a proposition that might
or might not have a proof. If there is a proof (which you
have to confirm yourself), you have a member; otherwise no.

In a nutshell, if you need to specify a *partial function*
in Lean, or a multi-valued relation, then you have to do it
with a declarative specification, not a computable function.
-/

/-
#### Worked Examples

So here's yet another example. While we were able to prove
that ("Hello", 7) is in the complete relation from String to
Nat, there is no proof that this pair is in strlen, which has
a much more restrictive membership predicate. Simply put, the
length of "Hello" (defined in the Lean libraries), is 5, and
7 is not equal to 5, so this pair can't be a member.
-/

example : strlen "Hello" 7 :=
-- What we need to prove is 7 = "Hello".length, i.e., 7 = 5.
  _     -- We're stuck, as there can be no proof of that.

/-!
We can of course prove that ("Hello", 7) is *not* in the
strlen relation. The proof is by negation. We'lll assume
this pair is the relation. That'll lead to the assumption
that 7 = 5, which is absurd. From that contradiction, we'll
conclude that the pair is *not* in the strlen relation.
-/

example : ¬strlen "Hello" 7 :=

/-
The proof is constructed by negation. Assume strlen "Hello" 7;
show that leads to a contradiction; conclude ¬strlen "Hello" 7.
You must know this concept, be able to state it clearly, be able
to see when you need it; and be able to use in to construct proofs
whether formal or informal. So here we go. (1) By the definition
of ¬, what we are really to prove is (strlen "Hello" 7) → False.
This is an implication. To prove it we will assume the premise is
true and that we have a proof of it (h : strlen "Hello" 7), and
we will then show that that can't happen (as revealed by the fact
that we'll have created a contradiction, showing that the initial
assumption was wrong).
-/
fun (h : strlen "Hello" 7) =>
/-
Now that we have our assumed proof of (strlen "Hello" 7) we have
to show that there's a contraction from which we can derive a
proof of False. The only information we have is the proof, h.
But how can we use it? The answer, for you, is that you again
want to see the need to expand a definition, here of the term,
(strlen "Hello" 7). What does that mean? *Go back and study the
definition of strlen!* It means (7 = "Hello".length), which is
to say, it means (7 = 5), as Lean will "run" the length function
to reduce "Hello".length to the result, 5. There can be no proof
of 7 = 5, because the only constructor of equality proofs, Eq.refl,
can only construct proofs that objects are equal to themselves.

Another way to say this is that we'll show that we can have a
proof of false for every possible proof, h, of 7 = 5; but there
are no, so showing that False is true in all cases is trivial,
as there is no case that can possibly account for h.
-/
  nomatch h

/-!
As a final example, we can prove that the pair, ("Hello",5), is
in strlen. In English, all we'd have to say is that this pair
satisfies the membership predicate because 5 = "Hello".length
(assuming we've properly defined "length,." which Lean has. )
-/

example : strlen "Hello" 5 :=
/-
By the definition of strlen, we must prove 5 = "Hello".length.
By the computation/reduction of "Hello".length this means 5 = 5.
And that is true by the reflecxivity of equality, as for any
value, k, whatsoever, we can have a proof of k = k by the rule
of equality introduction, Eq.refl k. The "rfl" construct we've
used in the past is just a shorthand for that, defined to infer
the value of k from context. And Lean takes care of reducing the
length function for us. We could write rfl here, but let's use
(Eq.refl 5) to get a better visual of the idea that what we're
producing here is a proof of 5 = 5.
-/
Eq.refl 5


/-
### A Finite String-Nat Relation

As our next example, suppose we want an even more restrictive
relation, one that could even be represented as a set of three
value pairs in the memory of a small computer. It'll be a small
subrelation of strlen we'll call strlen3, with the set of pairs,
{
  ("Hello", 5),
  ("Lean",  4),
  ("!",     1)
}.

#### Specification

To specify this relation formally in Lean all we have to do
is to figure out how to write the membership predicate. In
this example, we'll do it as a three-clause disjunction, on
clause for each pair.
-/

def strlen3 : Rel String Nat :=
  fun s n =>
    (s = "Hello" ∧ n = 5) ∨
    (s = "Lean" ∧ n = 4) ∨
    (s = "!" ∧ n = 1)

/-!
#### Worked Examples

We can prove memberships and non-membership of pairs in this
relation in the usual way: by proving the proposition that is
the result of applying the membership predicate to any pair of
values. But now that proposition will be a disjunction!
-/

example : strlen3 "Hello" 5 :=
  -- what we have to prove is the result of applying strlen3 to "Hello" and 5:
  -- ("Hello" = "Hello" ∧ 5 = 5) ∨ ("Hello" = "Lean" ∧ 5 = 4) ∨ ("Hello" = "!" ∧ 5 = 1)
  -- It's clear we can prove (and can only prove) the left disjunct; then it's two equalities
  Or.inl    -- prove the left disjunct ("Hello" = "Hello" ∧ 5 = 5), by left or introduction
    (
      And.intro   -- proof by and introduction
      rfl         -- "Hello" = "Hello"
      rfl         -- 5 = 5
    )

/-
We can also prove that ("Hello", 4) is not in the relation.
The proof is by negation followed by case analysis on the
3-case disjunction that defines the membership predicate.
We will assume (strlen3 "Hello" 4) is in the relation and t
then show that it doesn't satisfy any of the three disjuncts
and so can't be. From this contradiction we'll conclude that
¬(strlen3 "Hello" 4) is true.
-/

example : ¬strlen3 "Hello" 4 := fun h =>
-- proof by case analysis on assumed proof h : (strlen3 "Hello" 4),
-- which is to say h is a proof of ("Hello" = "Hello" ∧ 4 = 5) ∨ ...
match h with
  -- Is ("Hello", 4) the first allow pair, ("Hello", 5)?
  | Or.inl (p1 : "Hello" = "Hello" ∧ 4 = 5) =>
      let f : 4 = 5 := p1.right
      nomatch f       -- nope, can't have a proof of 4 = 5
  -- case analysis on right side of disjunction
  | Or.inr (rest : "Hello" = "Lean" ∧ 4 = 4 ∨ "Hello" = "!" ∧ 4 = 1) =>
      match rest with
      -- Is ("Hello", 4) the second allowed pair, ("Lean", 4)?
      | Or.inl p2 =>
        let f : "Hello" = "Lean" := p2.left
        nomatch f       -- nope, can't have proof of "Hello" = "Lean"
        -- Is ("Hello", 4) the third and last allowed pair, ("!", 1)
      | Or.inr p3 =>
        let f : "Hello" = "!" := p3.left
        nomatch f         -- nope, can't haver a proof of "Hello" = "!"
/-
Having shown there can be no proof of strlen3 "Hello" 4,
we conclude ¬strlen3 "Hello" 4. QED.
-/

-- Lean's smart enough to do all that work for us
example : ¬strlen "Hello" 4 := fun h => nomatch h

## Fundamental Definitions

In this section, we define important terms and underlying
concepts in the theory of relations. To illustrate the ideas,
we'll refer back to our running examples.
-/

/-!
### The Domain of Definition and Co-Domain of a Binary Relation

Given any relation on sets (types) α and β, we will refer to
α as the *domain of definition*, and β as the *co-domain* of
the relation. The domain of definition is the set of possible
inputs and the co-domain is the set of all possible outputs.
For each the relations we've considered as examples so far
(completeStrNat, strlen, and strlen3) are the sets of *all*
the values of the types, String and Nat, respectively.

The domain of definition and the codomain of each of the relations
we've specified as examples are all values of type α = String and
all values of type β = Nat, respectively.


### The Domain of a Binary Relation

The set of values, (a : α), that r *does* relate to β values,
i.e., the set of values that do appear in the first position of
any ordered pair, (a : α, b : β) in r, is called the *domain*
of r. The domain of r is the set of values on which r is said
to be *defined*. It's the set of *input* values, (a : α), for
which r specifies at least one output value, (b : β).

More formally, given a relation, r : Rel α β, the domain of r is
defined to be the set { x : α | ∃ y : β, r x y }. Another way to
say this is that the domain of r is the set of α values specified
by the predicate, fun x => ∃ y, r x y. In other words, x : α is
in  the domain of r if any only if there's some y : β such that
the pair of values, x, y, satisfies the two-place predicate r.

In Lean, if r is a binary relation (Rel.dom r) is its domain set.
-/

#reduce Rel.dom r
-- fun x => ∃ y, x ≺ y (where ≺ is simply infix notation for r)

/-!
The domain of the completeStrNat relation is all of α. It's the
same for strlen. The domain of strlen3 is just the set of the
three strings in its definition: { "Hello", "Lean", "!"}. The
domain of the empty relation is ∅, the empty set.
-/

#reduce Rel.dom strlen
-- fun x => ∃ y, strlen x y
-- the set of x values for which there's some y value in strlen

#reduce Rel.dom emptyStrNat
-- fun x => ∃ y, emptyStrNat x y
-- equivalent to { x | ∃ y, emptyStrNat x y }
-- but ∃ y, emptyStrNat x y reduces to False
-- this can also be written as { x | ∃ y, False}
-- no x values satisfy False, so this set is empty

/-!
We can now prove, for example, that "Hello" ∈ strlen3.dom.
By the definition of the domain of a relation, we need to
show (∃ y, strlen3 "Hello" y). As a witness for y, 5 will do.
-/

example : "Hello" ∈ strlen3.dom :=
  -- Prove there is (exist) some y such that ("Hello", y) is in strlen3.
  -- A constructive proof requires a witness for y. Clearly y = 5 will work

### The Range of a Binary Relation

The range is similarly defined but for output
values. The range of a relation, r, is the set
of all values, (b : β), for which there's some
(a : α) that r relates to b. As an example, not
every possible social security number is assigned
to a person. The set of numbers that are assigned
by the *ssna* relation is the *range* of this
relation.

Sadly, the Lean library currently refers to the
*range* of a relation as its codomain. In reality,
these terms are used somewhat inconsistently in
practice. So let's look at the definition of the
*range* (aka in Lean, codomain) of r. In Lean it
is (Rel.codom r) or (r.codom).
-/

/-
For any binary relation (of type Rel α β),
Rel.codom r, alsowritten as r.codom, is the set
specfified by the predicate, fun y => ∃ x, x ≺ y.
In set notation, this would be written as the
set, { (y : β) | ∃ (x : α), r x y }. Of course
this states that y is in the range of r if there
is an x in the domain of definition of r (and in
the domain) such that r relates x to y (r x y is
provable).
-/

-- Here's the set comprising the range of strlen3
#reduce strlen3.codom
#reduce (types:=true) strlen3.codom
-- fun y => ∃ x, strlen3 x y

-- Example: prove that 5 is in the codomain of strlen3
example : 5 ∈ strlen3.codom :=
/-
We need to prove ∃ x, strlen3 x 5. By the definition
of strlen3 this is (fun y => ∃ x, x = "Hello" ∧ y = 5 ∨
x = "Lean" ∧ y = 4 ∨ x = "!" ∧ y = 1). The proof is by
exists introduction with "Hello" as a witness and a proof
that the resulting pair satisfies the specification of
the relation (the disjunction).
-/

  -- ... with  "Hello" as a witness
  "Hello"
  -- ... and a proof that ("Hello", 5) is in strlen3

### The Inverse of a Binary Relation on Types/Sets α and β

The inverse of a relation, r, on α and β, is a relation on
β and α, comprising all the pair from r but with the first
and second element values swapped. Sometimes you'll see the
inverse of a binary relation, r, written as r⁻¹.

#### Specification
-/

#reduce Rel.inv
/-
The specification is easy. The membership predicate for
a pair, (b, a), to be in the inverse of a relation r is
that the pair (a, b) is in r. Think about it and you will
see that r.inv has to be the same as r but with all pairs
flipped.
-/

/-
#### Example
Example: What is the inverse of strlen3? In Lean it's writen
either (Rel.inv strlen3) or just strlen.inv. Remeber, This is
a predicate being used to represent a relation. The inverse
of r is a new predicate. If r takes areguments, a of types α,
and then b of type β, then r.inv takes as arguments some
(b : β) and (a : α) and returns the proposition that (a, b)
is in r. If there's a proof of that, then (b, a) is specified
to be in r.inv. To so prove that some (b, a) is in r⁻¹, you
just show that (a, b) ∈ r.
-/

/-!
Conjecture: (5, "Hello") is in the inverse of strlen3.
Proof: it suffices to prove ("Hello", 5) is in r. But
we've already done that once and don need to do it again
here! Oh, well, ok.
-/

example : strlen3.inv 5 "Hello"
  :=
  /-
    By the definition of the inverse of a relation,
    the proposition, (strlen3.inv 5 "Hello"), which
    we are to prove, reduces to (strlen3 "Hello" 5).
    By the definition of strlen3, this proposition
    tne reduces to ("Hello" = "Hello" ∧ 5 = 5) ∨ ...
    This proposition is now proved by or introduction
    on the left.
  -/
  Or.inl ⟨ rfl, rfl⟩
-- Remember ⟨ _, _ ⟩ here is shorthand for And.intro

/-!
We can actually now state and prove more general theorems
showing that the inverse operation has the property that
appying it twice is equivalent to doing nothing at all.
Think about it: if (a, b) is in r, then (b, a) is in the
inverse of r, but now (a, b) must be in the inverse  of
this inverse of r. Going the other way, if (a, b) is in
the inverse of the inverse of r, then (b, a) must be in
the inverse of r, in whcih case (a, b) must be in r. In
other words, (a, b) is in r if and only if (a, b) is in
the inverse of the inverse of r. We want to know that this
statement is true for *any* values of a and b (of their
respective types).
-/

theorem inverseInverseIsId:
  ∀ {α β : Type} (rel : Rel α β) (a : α) (b : β), rel a b ↔ rel.inv.inv a b :=
-- assume a and b are arbitrary values (by ∀ introduction)

-- prove r a b ↔ r.inv.inv a b

### The Image of a Set Under a Binary Relation

Suppose we have a binary relation, (r : Rel α β),
and a set of α values, (s : Set α). The image of s
under r is the set of values that, in a sense, you
get by iterating over all the elements of s, getting
one element, e, at a time, then finding all the the
"output" values in r for that one "input" value and
finally combinining all of these output into  output
set. We don't write that as a program, though, but
as a mathematical specification.

#### Specification

Here you can see the formal definition of the image
of a set s under a relation r.
-/

#reduce Rel.image
-- fun r s y => ∃ x ∈ s, r x y

/-!
Given a relation, r, a set of input values, s, and a
y of the output type, y is specified to be in the image
of r when there is some input value, x, in s, such that
r relates x to y. In other words, the image of s under r
is the set of all output values for any and all ainput
values in s.
-/

#reduce Rel.image
-- fun r s y => ∃ x ∈ s, r x y
/-!
Given any relation, r, and any set of input values,
s, an output value y is (defined to be) in "the image
of s under r" exactly when y is the output of r for
at least one (some) value x in the set s. The image
operator on a relation acts like it's applying the
whole relation to a whole set of values and getting
back all values related to any value in the argument
set.
-/

/-
#### Examples

In this example we consider the image of the two-member
set, { "Hello", "!"}, under the strlen3 relation. You can
see intuitively that it must be the set {5, 1}, insofar as
strlen3 relates "Hello" to (only) 5, and "!" to (only) and
there are no other values in s. Let's see what we're saying
formally, as reported by Lean. *Be sure you understand all
of the outputs of #reduce that we're presenting over in this
lesson!
-/

#reduce Rel.image strlen3 { "Hello", "!"}
-- Here's an easier way to write the same thing
#reduce strlen3.image {"Hello", "!"}
-- fun y => ∃ x ∈ {"Hello", "!"}, strlen3 x y

/-!
The image, specified by the *single-argument* predicate,
fun y => ∃ x ∈ {"Hello", "!"}, strlen3 x y, is, again, the
set of all output (β) values, y, such that, for any given y
there is some x in s that r relates to y.
-/

/-!
Given this definition and our understanding, we see that
it should be possible to show that, say, 1, is in the
image of { "Hello", "!"} under strlen3, because there is
a string in the set,  { "Hello", "!"}, namely "!", that
r relates to 1 (for which (strlen3 "!" 1) is true).
-/

example : 1 ∈ strlen3.image { "Hello", "!"} :=
/-
By the definition of Rel.image we need to prove
is that there is some string, x, in the set, call
it s, of strings, that satisfies strlen3 s 1. This
string, in s, will of course be "!", so that will
be our witness. The proof is by exits introduction
with "!" as the witness.
-/
Exists.intro "!"
(
  -- what remains to be proved is "!" ∈ {"Hello", "!"} ∧ strlen3 "!" 1
  -- the proof is by and introduction
  And.intro

     -- prove: "!" ∈ {"Hello", "!"}
     -- this is obvious but, sorry, maybe I'll prove it later
    (sorry)

    -- prove: strlen3 "!" 1
    -- this is obvious but, sorry, maybe I'll prove it later
    (sorry)
)

/-
We should also be able to show that 4 is not in the image of
s under strlen3. The proof is by negation. We'll assume that
4 is in the image, but we have already figured out that the
only elements in there are 5 and 1 (from "Hello" and "!"). The
problem will be that assuming 4 is in the set isto assume that
4 = 5 ∨ 4 = 1. That's a contraction as each case leads to an
impossibiility. Thus 4 ∉ strlen3.image { "Hello", "!"}. QED,
-/

example : 4 ∉ strlen3.image { "Hello", "!"}  :=
-- assume, h, that 4 is in this set
fun h =>
  -- From 4 ∈ strlen3.image {"Hello", "!"}, prove False
  -- By the definition of image, h proves ∃ s, strlen3 s 4
  -- The only information we have to work with is h
  -- And the only thing we can do with it is elimination
  Exists.elim
    h
    -- ∀ (a : String), a ∈ {"Hello", "!"} ∧ strlen3 a 4 → False
    -- we assumed r relates some string in s to 4 call it w
    (
      fun w =>
        (
          -- prove: w ∈ {"Hello", "!"} ∧ strlen3 w 4 → False
          -- assume premise : w ∈ {"Hello", "!"} ∧ strlen3 w 4
          fun p =>
          (
            let l := p.left
            let r := p.right

            -- recognize that w proves a disjunction
            -- eliminate using Or.elim via pattern matching
            -- case analysis
            match l with
            -- left case, with "hello" a proof of w = "Hello" (in this case)
            -- we also have r, a proof of (strlen3 w 4)
            -- we can use "hello" to rewrite (strlen3 w 4) to (strlen3 "Hello" 4)
            -- by the definition of strlen3 this is a disjuncion that is false
            -- using
            | Or.inl hello =>
              /-
                We haven't talked about "tactic mode" in Lean. Without getting
                into details, we're arging that because "hello" proves w = "Hello",
                we can replace w in r, which proves strlen3 w 4, to get a proof
                of strlen3 "Hello" 4. But the pair, ("Hello", 4), is not in the
                strlen3 relation, as that pair of arguments doesn't satisfy the
                constraint it imposes on membership. The nomatch construct does
                a case analysis on this rewritten version of r and finding that
                there are no ways it could be true, dismisses this overall case.
              -/
              (
                by
                  rw [hello] at r
                  nomatch r
              )

            -- the second case, w ∈ { "!" } requires deducing from that that w = "!"
            -- that then allows us to rewrite (strlen3 w 4) to (strlen3 "!" 4)
            -- by the definition of strlen3, that'd mean, inter alia, that 1 = 4
            | Or.inr excl  =>
              (
                have wexcl : w = "!" := excl
                (
                  by
                    rw [wexcl] at r
                    nomatch r
                )
              )
          )
        )
    )

/-!
In each case, where s = "Hello" or where s = "!", we have a
contradiction: that s.length (either 5 or 1) is equal to 4.
In each case we're able to derive a contradiction, showing
that the assumption that 4 ∈ strlen3.image {"Hello", "!"} is
wrong, therefore ¬4 ∈ strlen3.image {"Hello", "!"} is true.
QED.

### Example: What are Mary's Bank Account Numbers?

Let's make up a new example. We want to create
a little "relational database" with one relation,
a binary relation, that associates each person
(ok, their name as a string) with his or her bank
account number(s), if any.

There's no limit on the number of bank accounts
any single person can have. A person could have
no bank accounts, as well. To be concrete, let's
assume there are three people, "Mary," "Lu," and
"Bob", that Mary has accounts #1 and #2; Lu has
account #3; and that Bob has no bank account at all.

We can think of the relation (call it acctsOf) as
the set of pairs, { Mary, 1), (Mary, 2), (Lu, 3) }.
One thing to see here is that the image of { Mary }
under acctsOf is not a single value but a set of two
values: {1, 2}. This relation is not single-valued.
Another point is that it's not complete, as there
is no output at all for Bob.
-/

def acctsOf : Rel String Nat := fun s n =>
s = "Mary" ∧ n = 1 ∨
s = "Mary" ∧ n = 2 ∨
s = "Lu"   ∧ n = 3

/-!
Let's remind ourselves how the image of the set,
{ "Mary" } under the acctsOf relation is defined.
As usual, hover over "#reduce" to see its output.
-/
#reduce acctsOf.image { "Mary" }

/-!
acctsOf.image {"Mary"} is the set specified by this
predicate: fun y => ∃ x ∈ {"Mary"}, acctsOf x y. In
English, y is in the image if there's some x in the
set of inputs ({ "Mary" }), such that (acctsOf x y)
is satisfied.
-/

-- Proof that 1 is in acctsOf.image { "Mary" }
example : 1 ∈ acctsOf.image { "Mary" } :=
/-
By the definition of image, we need to prove
∃ x ∈ {"Mary"}, acctsOf x y. At this point, we
have to find/pick a witness---here an input value
in the set, { "Mary"} )--- for which 1 is among
the outputs. Then we just prove that that pair
is in fact in the relation.

The proof is by exists introduction. We show
that there is some x in { "Mary" } *and* for
that x, (x, 1) is in acctsOf. The only possible
x to choose in this case is "Mary".
-/

  -- Pick "Mary" as the witness

### Example: The Unit Circle is a Multi-Valued Relation

Here we see another relation that is not single-valued: the
binary relation on the real numbers satisfying the predicate,
x² + y² = 1. This equation is of course the algebraic relation
satisfied by all and only the points on the unit circle at the
origin of the Cartesian plane. It is multi-valued, with several
output values for at least some of its inputs.

In any case, if you pick certain x values, such as 0, there are
two corresponding y values that satisfy the relation. Plugging in
0 for x, we have y² = 1, with two solutions: y = -1, and y = 1.
We can thus see that the image of { 0 } under this relation is
the set, { -1, 1 }.

#### Specification

Here's our formal specification of the relation.
-/

-- In Lean, Real is the type of the real numbers
-- Here we use the notation, ℝ, for Real. Either is ok.
def unitCircle : Rel ℝ ℝ := fun x y => x^2 + y^2 = 1

/-!
#### Example

We might expect to be able to prove a proposition such
as (unitCircle 0 1) by simple reduction to the claim,
0^2 + 1^2 = 1, with Eq.refl (rfl) forcing this term to
reduce to 1 = 1, which is then proved by (Eq.refl 1). But
the real numbers are troublesome. One *cannot* compute with
them in general. (A float type in a language such as Python,
C, or Java is type of finite approximations, but is *not*
equivalent to "real" real numbers.)
-/

example : unitCircle 0 (-1) := rfl    -- doesn't work!

/-!
Of course there is a way to prove that this proposition
is true. The complication here is You have to use more
complex reasoning based on facts we don't have the time
to cover in this class.

#### Introducing Tactics in Lean

*Fortunately* Lean comes with a tactic (one of many) called
simp that, when given a set of definitions to use, will to try
to *simplify* (and if it can, actually prove) a goal, such as
the one here, without you having to lift a finger.

A tactic is not "Lean code" per se, but rather a program that
someone wrote (in Lean) that automates some aspect of proof
construction. The simp tactic tries to find and apply a set
of definitions to simplify a goal so that you don't have to
do it all yourself. In lucky cases, it will simplify it all
the way to an equality that can be proven by Eq.refl.

Here then is a demonstration that there is a formal
proof that (0, -1) is on the unit circle. You must
understand that simp (and tactics more generally)
automatically write proof code for you. You don't see
the actual "proof object" here, but you can see that
the Lean prover has accepted it, so you can rest easy
knowing that the proposition that (0, -1) is on the
unit circle. Here we tell simp to use not only the set
of general definitions it knows about but also, very
crucially, the definition of unitCircle.
-/
example : unitCircle 0 (-1) :=
  by
    simp [unitCircle]

/-!
Wow, ok! Lean doesn't just support direct programming
of proof terms by hand, but provides a huge library of
tactics for helping to prove all kinds of propositions.
The translation of the tactic-built proof that simp
finds for you into English is easy. You can just say,
*by the definition of unitCircle* (and other basic
rules of algebra), the proposition is proved.
-/

/-!
For those interested in futher study, Lean has a
ton of options you can set to have it tell you more
or less information as it goes. The following option
tells Lean to tell you what facts the simp tactic, in
particular, used in trying to produce a proof for you.
Don't worry about the details, just be happy you did
not have to assemble that proof on your own!
-/
set_option tactic.simp.trace true in
-- hover over simp to see all the definitions it used
example : unitCircle 0 (-1) :=
  by
    simp [unitCircle]


/-!
Now that we have the tools we need to prove propositions
about membership in the unitCircle relation, we should be
all set to prove propositions about membership in the image
of a given set of input values under the unitCircle relation.

We can see that if the input values are {x = 0, x = 1} that
the corresponding set of output values should be {-1, 1, 0}.
If you don't see that, you need to review basic algebra and
confirm that (0, -1), (0, 1), and (1, 0) are points on the
unit circle.

Here's the expression for the image set (of output values)
for the set of input values, { 0, 1}. Hovering over #reduce
gives you the predicate that defines the output/image set.
-/
#reduce unitCircle.image { 0, 1 }
-- fun y => ∃ x ∈ {0, 1}, unitCircle x y


/-!
So now we're set: Let's prove that -1 is in the image
of { 0, 1 } under the unitCircle relation. Here's the
claim/proposition, followed by the proof. As usual, you
cannot just read this proof. Use Lean to interact with
it, to understand the reasoning at each step, what is
left to prove after each step, and how the whole thing
really does (firmly in your mind) prove that one of the
outputs given inputs 0 and 1 is in fact -1.
-/

example : -1 ∈ unitCircle.image { 0, 1 } :=
/-
By the definition of image, what we have to show is
that ∃ x ∈ { 0, 1 } such that (x, -1) is in the image.
The proof is thus by exists introduction, and we have
to pick a witness that will make the remaining proof
go through. The only value that x/input value in that
set that will work is 0.
-/
